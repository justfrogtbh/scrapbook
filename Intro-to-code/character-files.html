        <div>William Miller is a young man who grew up in a close knit family in the American countryside, until his dream to become a police officer dragged him and his focus to the nearby [name] city. Though, thanks to his meek attitude, short temper and tendency to fall asleep during the exams he had to sit he was thrown out and instead became a customer service employee for Sol Inc. Now he lives most of his days gloomily in the darkness of the night, not knowing the light that is waiting for him in his future.</div>
